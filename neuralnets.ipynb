    "Neural Network is a computer model which contains many neurons segregated as layers , there are mainly 3 layers , input output and hidden layers . A neuron is a small computational unit which is connected to other neurons and takes input from them , it has a bias , weights and an activation function . The input in the neuron comes in the form of summation of product of input values and weights and at last bias of the current neuron is added to it , later this value is passed through an activation function in which it decides the final value to output to next neuron or even the decision to whether output the value to the next neuron or not                                                                             \n",
